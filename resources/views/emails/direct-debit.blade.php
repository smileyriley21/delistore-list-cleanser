<p style="font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dear {{ $name }},</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;">
    I hope you are well. You should have received a letter in the post from us, confirming that we are now your new
    website provider, having taken over from Mistore Ltd.
    Firstly, please rest assured that you are in capable hands and we are looking forward to providing you with the
    highest level of service.
</p>


<p style="font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:26px">What Next?</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;">We need to ensure that your recurring payments
    are transferred over to us. Don’t worry, we will outline everything you need to do below and we are here to help if
    you need us.</p>


<p style="font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:26px">Step 1 – Cancel your existing
    standing order</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you currently have a standing order set up to
    Mistore Ltd, please cancel this with your bank as soon as you can. Mistore does not have the authority to do
    this.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;">Don’t worry, any standing order payments made to
    Mistore will be transferred to Spoken, but we would like to ensure we receive payment from you direct as soon as
    possible.</p>
